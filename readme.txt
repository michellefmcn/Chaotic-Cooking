Chaotic Cooking !

Description: 
Chaotic Cooking ! is a spin off of the popular game, Overcooked 2, where a 
player works against the clock to serve customers in a busy restaurant kitchen. 
Each order will have a countdown timer, so the food must be served before the 
customer becomes too impatient to wait. The less a customer has to wait, the 
more tips the player will receive! The amount of money earned will allow the 
player to earn up to 3 stars for an employee of the month certificate reward. 
To prepare food, the players will have to chop up meat to create burger patties 
and cook the patties to perfection without burning them. Mistakes result in 
overcooked food that will be thrown away, thus decreasing the profits the player 
will make. Food must also be assembled in the correct order to gain maximum 
points!
